A (junk) collection of codes I have written for my research

This repository contains codes I have written for my research over the years. I am systematically making them avaiable on this repository rather than uploading them on my personal website. 

You are free to use or modify these codes. I cannot guarantee the performance of these codes but if you did find it useful, I would appreciate if you can aknowledge the source and my contributions. 

The repository currently consists of the following files:
1. DiscreteChoice.py

DiscreteChoice.py:

The file contains the code to create an object for purposes of estimating basic logit and probit models using predominately time series data. Several methods have also been implemented for purposes of testing structural stability, especially in the presence of serial correlation. 

Installation: Put the file in the python path or in the same directory as the python file that will call it. The usual 
  import DiscreteChoice as DC
will import everything from the file in the usual way.
